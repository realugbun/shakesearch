# Hi

I saw one of your team post this challange on Reddit this morning. I took a few minutes to take a stab at it. There's lots more to do but I've got a full time job in DevOps at an automation startup so this is what I've got.

I pushed some basic changes to the frontend in the most resent update.

If I had more time, I would add a link to see more context of the searched term and a link to an online edition of the works using the refrence I supplied.

You can see what the results look like in the ExampleResults.png

Best regards
