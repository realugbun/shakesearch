# Hi

I saw one of your team post this challange on Reddit this morning. I took a few minutes to take a stab at it. There's lots more to do but I've got a full time job in DevOps at an automation startup so this is what I've got.

I didn't touch the front end. Yes, my code could be cleanded up and there is an edge case I'd like to take care of but didn't get to it. Basically, the backend returns the line preceeding and following the line with the matching search term. If it matches the first or last line of the file, there could be a problem.

If I had more time, I would add a link to see more context of the searched term and a link to an online edition of the works using the refrence I supplied.

You can see what the results look like in the ExampleResults.png

Best regards
